# India Crop Yield Data Analysis

This repo contains code to perform EDA and train ML models on the [Indian Crop Yield Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anandsubbu007/crop-production-prediction) from Kaggle. 
The dataset contains crop yield data from Indian States from 1997-2015. Here is a small extract of the data.

Extensive EDA has been performed for a single state "Maharashtra" as the range of values in the entire dataset is too high to perform meaningful manipulations. A Random Forest Model is trained on the data 
and the Root Mean Squared Error is shown.
